A Remote Browser's Agent ( XSS ) is a piece of software that allows a remote "operator" to control a browser as if he has physical access to that system.
While desktop sharing and remote administration have many legal uses, "XSS" software is usually associated with criminal or malicious activity.
Malicious XSS agent software is typically injected without the victim's knowledge, often as payload on a website, and will try to hide its operation
from the victim and from security software. </Information><Targets>Targets vulnerables</Targets></Module>
